\section{1. Speaking Mathematically}
\subsection{Important Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbb{N}$: the set of all natural numbers (include $0$, i.e. $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$)
    \item $\mathbb{Z}$: the set of all integers
    \item $\mathbb{Q}$: the set of all rational numbers
    \item $\mathbb{R}$: the set of all real numbers
    \item $\mathbb{C}$: the set of all complex numbers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Universal Statement $\forall$: A certain property is true for \textbf{all} elements in a set
    \item Conditional statement $\rightarrow$: If one thing is true then some other thing has to be true
    \item Existential Statement $\exists$: There is \textbf{at least one} thing for which a certain property is true
    \item Universal Conditional Statement
    \item Universal Existential Statement
    \item Existential Universal Statement (not the same!)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terms used in Proofs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition: Precise and unambiguous description of mathematical term.
    \item Axiom / Postulate: A statement that is assumed to be true without proof.
    \item Theorem: A mathematical statement that is proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning.
    \item Lemma: A small theorem; a minor result which helps to prove a theorem.
    \item Corollary: A result that is a simple deduction from a theorem.
    \item Conjecture: A statement believed to be true, but for which there is no proof (yet).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Properties of Integers on Addition and Multiplication}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Closure: $x+y \in \mathbb{Z}$
    \item Commutativity: $x+y = y+x$
    \item Associativity: $x+y+z = (x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$
    \item Distributivity: $x(y+z) = xy + xz$
    \item Trichotomy: $x = y$ or $x < y$ or $x > y$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Number Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Even and Odd Integers (Lecture 1 Slide 27): An integer is even iff $\exists k s.t. n = 2k$. An integer is odd iff $\exists k s.t. n = 2k+1$. Every integer is even or odd, but not both (Assumption 1).
    \item Without Loss Of Generality (WLOG): Used before an assumption in a proof which narrows the premise to some special case, and implies that the proof for that case can be easily applied to all other cases.
    \item Counter-Example: Shows that a statement is not always true.
    \item Divisibility (Lecture 1 Slide 32): If n and d are integers with $d \neq 0$, $d \mid n$ iff $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $n = dk$
    \item Theorem 4.7.1: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
    \item Rational and Irrational Numbers: r is rational iff $\exists a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $r = \frac{a}{b}, b \neq 0$
    \item Fraction in lowest term (Lecture 1 Slide 37): A fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is said to be in lowest terms if the largest integer that divides both a and b is 1. Every rational can be reduced to a fraction in its lowest term. (Assumption 2)
    \item Proposition 4.6.4: For all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even. (Proof by contraposition)
    \item Colorful (CS1231S): An integer $n$ is colorful if $\exists k$ s.t. $n = 3k$
\end{itemize}

\section{2. The Logic of Compound Statements}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Defn 2.1.1 (Statement): A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false, but not both.
    \item Defn 2.1.2 (Negation): The negation of p is "not p" and is denoted $\lnot p$.
    \item Defn 2.1.3 (Conjunction): The conjunction of p and q is "p and q", denoted $p \land q$.
    \item Defn 2.1.4 (Disjunction): The disjunction of p and q is "p or q", denoted $p \lor q$.
    \item Defn 2.1.5 (Statement Form / Propositional Form): A statement form (or propositional form) is an expression made up of statement variables and logical connectives.
    \item Defn 2.1.6 (Logical Equivalence): Two statement forms are logically equivalent iff they have identical truth values for each possible substitution of statements for their statement variables. The logical equivalence of P and Q is denoted by $P \equiv Q$.
    \item Defn 2.1.7 (Tautology): A tautology is a statement form that is always true regardless of the truth values of its statement variables.
    \item Defn 2.1.8 (Contradiction): A contradiction is a statement form that is always false regardless of the truth values of its statement variables.
    \item Defn 2.2.1 (Conditional): The conditional of q by p is "if p then q", denoted $p \rightarrow q$. p is the hypothesis (antecedent), and q is the conclusion (consequent).
    \item Defn 2.2.2 (Contrapositive): The contrapositive of a conditional statement $p \rightarrow q$ is $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$
    \item Defn 2.2.3 (Converse): The converse of a conditional statement $p \rightarrow q$ is $q \rightarrow p$ 
    \item Defn 2.2.4 (Inverse): The inverse of a conditional statement $p \rightarrow q$ is $\lnot p \rightarrow \lnot q$ 
    \item Defn 2.2.5 (Only if): "p only if q" means $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$ or "if p then q" $p \rightarrow q$
    \item Defn 2.2.6 (Biconditional): The biconditional of p and q is "p if and only if q" and is denoted "$p \leftrightarrow q$"
    \item Defn 2.2.7 (Necessary and Sufficient Conditions): "r is a sufficient condition for s" means $r \rightarrow s$, "r is a necessary condition for s" means $s \rightarrow r$
    \item Defn 2.3.1 (Argument): An argument is a sequence of statements. All statements except for the final one are called premises, while the final statement is called the conclusion. The symbol $\therefore$ is normally placed before the conclusion. An argument form is valid if the conclusion is true when all the premises are true.
    \item Defn 2.3.2 (Sound and Unsound Arguments): an argument is sound iff it is valid and all its premises are true. An argument that is not sound is unsound.

\end{itemize}
\end{multicols*}

\subsection{Compund Statements Notes}
\begin{itemize}
     \item Order of Operations: $\lnot, \land / \lor, \rightarrow / \leftrightarrow$ \ (use parentheses if ambiguous)
    \item Show logical unequivalence by (i) finding a different row in truth table, (ii) finding a counter example.
    \item A conditional statement is vacuously true when the hypothesis is false.
    \item A conditional is logically equivalent with its contrapositive, which is the negation of its converse / inverse.
    \item If r is a sufficient condition for s, then r is sufficient to guarantee the occurrence of r.
    \item If r is a necessary condition for s, s cannot occur without r.
    \item To test an argument form for validity, construct the truth table. A critical row is a row in the truth table in which all premises are true. If there is a critical row in which the conclusion is false, the argument form is invalid. If there are no critical rows, the argument is vacuously valid.
\end{itemize}

\section{3. The Logic of Quantified Statements}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Defn 3.1.1 (Predicate): A predicate is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables and becomes a statement when specific values are substituted for the variables. The domain of a predicate variable is the set of all values that may be substituted in place of the variable.
    \item Defn 3.1.2 (Truth Set): If $P(x)$ is a predicate and $x$ has domain $D$, the truth set has all elements of $D$ that make $P(x)$ true when substituted for x, denoted by $\{x \in D \mid P(x)\}$
    \item Defn 3.1.3 (Universal Statement): Let $Q(x)$ be a predicate and $D$ the domain of $x$. A universal statement has the form $\forall x \in D, Q(x)$. A value for $x$ for which $Q(x)$ is false is a counterexample.
    \item Defn 3.1.4 (Existential Statement): Let $Q(x)$ be a predicate and $D$ the domain of $x$. An existential statement has the form $\exists x \in D$ s.t. $Q(x)$. The symbol $\exists !$ is used to denote uniqueness.
    \item Theorem 3.2.1 Negation of a Universal Statment: The negation of the statement $\forall x \in D, P(x)$ is equivalent to $\exists x \in D$  s.t. $\lnot P(x)$
    \item Theorem 3.2.2 Negation of an Existential Statement: The negation of the statment $\exists x \in D$ s.t. $P(x)$ is equivalent to $\forall x \in D, \lnot P(x)$
    \item Defn 3.2.1 (Contrapositive, Converse, Inverse): These terms can also be applied on universal conditional statements.
    \item Defn 3.2.2 (Necessary and Sufficient conditions, Only if): These terms can also be applied on universal conditional statements.
    \item Defn 3.4.1 (Valid Argument Form): An argument form is valid if no matter what predicates are substituted in its premises, if the premise statements are all true, then the conclusion is also true. An argument is valid iff its form is valid.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Arguments with Quantified Statements}
\begin{multicols*}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Universal Modus Ponens:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$
        \item $P(a)$ for a particular $a$
        \item $\therefore Q(a)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Universal Modus Tollens
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x, (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)$
        \item $\lnot Q(a)$ for a particular $a$
        \item $\therefore \lnot P(a)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Universal Transitivity
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)$
        \item $\forall x (Q(x) \rightarrow R(x)$
        \item $\therefore \forall x (P(x) \rightarrow R(x)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Universal Instantiation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x \in D P(x)$
        \item $\therefore P(a)$ if $a \in D$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Universal Generalisation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P(a)$ for every $a \in D$
        \item $\therefore \forall x \in D P(x)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Existential Instantiation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\exists x \in D P(x)$
        \item $\therefore P(a)$ for some  $a \in D$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Existential Generalisation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $P(a)$ for some $a \in D$
        \item $\exists x \in D P(x)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Converse Error
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$
        \item $Q(a)$ for a particular $a$
        \item $\therefore P(a)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Inverse Error
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$
        \item $\lnot P(a)$ for a particular $a$
        \item $\therefore \lnot Q(a)$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols*}

\subsection{Quantified Statements Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To show a universal statement is true, we use exhaustion. To show it is false, we use a counterexample.
    \item To show an existential statement is true, we use an example. To show it is false, we use exhaustion.
    \item $\forall x \in D, Q(x) \equiv Q(x_1) \land Q(x_2) \land ... \land Q(x_n)$, and $\exists x \in D, Q(x) \equiv Q(x_1) \lor Q(x_2) \lor ... \lor Q(x_n)$
    \item Universal statements can be vacuously true if the predicate of a conditional is false for every element in the domain, which also happens if the domain is empty.
    \item In a statement with multiple quantifiers, the order of quantifiers with the \textbf{SAME} type can be interchanged.
\end{itemize}

\section{4. Methods of Proof}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prime: An integer $n$ is prime iff $n > 1$ and $\forall r, s$, if $n = rs$ then $r = n$ or $s = n$.
    \item Composite: An integer $n$ is composite iff $n > 1$ and $\exists r, s$ s.t. $n = rs$, $1 < r < n$, $1 < s < n$.
    \item Theorem 4.2.1: Every integer is a rational number. (Prove with $\frac{a}{1}$)
    \item Theorem 4.2.2: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational. (Proof by algebra)
    \item Corollary 4.2.3: The double of a rational number is rational.
    \item Theorem 4.3.1: $\forall a, b$, if $a \mid b$ then $a \leq b$ (Proof by algebra)
    \item Theorem 4.3.2: The only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1 (Proof by cases)
    \item Theorem 4.3.3: $\forall a, b, c$ if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$ then $a \mid c$
    \item Theorem 4.6.1: There is no greatest integer (Proof by contradiction)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proofs}

\subsection{Methods of Proof}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct Proof: Show a series of steps leading from start to end. Deduction is a type of direct proof.
    \item Divison into Cases: Split the statement into cases and show it is true in all of them.
    \item Constructive Proof of Existential statements: Provide an example where the statement is true.
    \item Disproving Universal Statements by Counterexample: Give a counterexample where the negation is true, or where the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.
    \item Proving Universal Statements by Exhaustion: Show the statement is true for every element in the domain.
    \item Proving Universal Statements by Generalizing from the Generic Particular: Suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of the set, show x satisfies the property.
    \item Proof by Contradiction:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose the statement to be proved, $S$, is false. That is, the negation of the statement, $\lnot S$, is true.
        \item Show that this supposition leads logically to a contradiction.
        \item Conclude that the statement $S$ is true.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Proof by Contraposition: Prove the contraposition of the statement instead.
\end{itemize}

\section{5. Set Theory}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set: An \textbf{unordered} collection of objects (members / elements)
    \item Set-Roster Notation: Write all elements of the set between braces.
    \item Membership of a set: $x \in S$ means $x$ is an element of $S$. Similarly, $x \notin S$ means $x$ is not an element of $S$.
    \item Cardinality of a set: $\mid S \mid$ is the size of the set $S$, or the number of elements in $S$.
    \item Set-Builder Notation: Let $U$ be a set and $P(x)$ be a predicate over $U$. Then the set of $x \in U$ s.t. $P(x)$ is true is $\{x \in U : P(x)\}$.
    \item Replacement Notation: Let $A$ be a set and $t(x)$ be a term in a variable $x$. Then the set of all objects of the form $t(x)$ where $x \in A$ is $\{t(x) : x \in A\}$.
    \item Subset and Superset: Let A and B be sets. A is a subset of B, $A \subseteq B$, iff every element in A is also an element of B. We can also write $B \supseteq A$ or B is a superset of A.
    \item Proper Subset: A is a proper subset of B, $A \subsetneq B$ iff $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$.
    \item Empty Set: $\emptyset$
    \item Theorem 6.2.4: An empty set is a subset of every set, $\forall A, \emptyset \subseteq A$
    \item Singleton: Set with exactly one element.\

\section{6. Relations}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relation: A binary relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A \times B$. Given an ordered pair $(x, y)$ in $A \times B$, $x$ is related to $y$ by $R$, $x R y$, iff $(x, y) \in R$
    \item Domain, Co-Domain, Range: Let $R$ be a relation from $A$ to $B$. Domain is the set $\{a \in A : a R b$ for some $b \in B\}$. Co-Domain is B. Range is the set $\{b \in B : a R b$ for some $a \in A\}$
    \item Inverse Relation: The inverse relation $R^{-1}$ is $\{(y, x) \in B \times A : (x, y) \in R\}$
    \item Relation on a Set: A relation on a set $A$ is a subset of $A \times A$.
    \item Composite Relations: Let $R \subseteq A \times B$ and $S \subseteq B \times C$ be relations. The composition of $R$ with $S$, denoted $S \circ R$ is the relation from $A$ to $C$ s.t. $\forall x \in A, \forall Z \in C, x S \circ R z \leftrightarrow (\exists y \in B, x R y \land y S z)$.
    \item Proposition: Composition is Associative

    \item Partition: $\mathscr{C}$ is a partition of $A$ if (i) $\mathscr{C}$ is a set where all elements are non-empty subsets of $A$, (ii) Every element of $A$ is in exactly one element of $\mathscr{C}$. Elements of a partition are components. Alternatively, $\forall x \in A, \exists ! S \in \mathscr{C} (x \in S)$.
    \item Relation Induced by Partition: The relation $R$ induced by a partition on $A$ is $\forall x, y, \in A, x R y \leftrightarrow \exists$ a component $S$ of $\mathscr{C}$ s.t. $x, y, \in S$.
    \item Theorem 8.3.1 Relation Induced by a Partition: $R$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
    \item Equivalence Relation: $R$ is an equivalence relation iff $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. The symbol $\lnot$ is commonly used.
    \item Equivalence Class: Suppose $A$ is a set and $\lnot$ is an equivalence relation on $A$. For each $a \in A$, the equivalence class of $a$, $[a]$, is the set of elements $x \in A$ s.t. $a \lnot x$. $[a]_{\lnot} = \{x \in A : a \lnot x\}$
    \item Theorem 8.3.4: The partition Induced by an Equivalence Relation: If $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$, then the distinct equivalence classes of $R$ form a partition of $A$.
    \item Congruence: $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ iff $a-b = nk$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

    \item Set of equivalence classes: $A / \lnot$ is the set of all equivalence classes with respect to $\lnot$, $A / \lnot = \{[x]_{\lnot} : x \in A\}$.
    \item Partial Order Relation: $R$ is a partial order iff $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
    \item Partially Ordered Set: $A$ is a poset with respect to a partial order relation $R$ on $A$, $(A, R)$.
    \item Curly Less Than Equals: $\preccurlyeq$ is used for partial orders to prevent confusion with $\leq$.
    \item Hasse Diagrams: Simplification of the directed graph of a partial order relation. Place vertices s.t. all arrows point upwards, then remove all self-loops, remove arrows implied by transitivity, and remove direction indicators.
    \item Comparable: $a$ and $b$ are comparable iff $a \preccurlyeq b$ or $b \preccurlyeq a$. If not, they are noncomparable.
    \item Compatible: $a$ and $b$ are compatible iff $\exists c \in A, a \preccurlyeq c, b \preccurlyeq c$. (There are other possible definitions, be careful.)
    \item Maximal Element: $c$ is maximal iff $\forall x \in A, c \preccurlyeq x \rightarrow c = x$.
    \item Minimal Element: $c$ is minimal iff $\forall x \in A, x \preccurlyeq c \rightarrow c = x$.
    \item Largest Element: $c$ is the largest iff $\forall x \in A, x \preccurlyeq c$.
    \item Smallest Element: $c$ is the smallest iff $\forall x \in A, c \preccurlyeq x$.
    \item Total Order Relations: $R$ is a total order relation if $R$ is a partial order and $\forall x, y \in A, x R y \lor y R x$.
    \item Linearization: A total order s.t. $x \preccurlyeq y \rightarrow x \preccurlyeq^* y$.
    \item Well-Ordered Set: $A$ is well-ordered iff every non-empty subset of $A$ contains a smallest (not minimal) element.

    \item (i) $x \lnot y$
    \item (ii) $[x] = [y]$
    \item (iii) $[x] \cap [y] \neq \emptyset$
\end{itemize}
Proof
\begin{itemize}
    \item (i) $\rightarrow (ii)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $x \lnot y$
        \item $y \lnot x$ by symmetry
        \item For every $z \in [x]$
        \item $x \lnot z$ by definition of $[x]$
        \item $y \lnot z$ by transitivity
        \item $z \in [y]$ by definition of $[y]$
        \item $\therefore [x] \subseteq [y]$
        \item Similarly for $[y] \subseteq [x]$
        \item $\therefore [x] = [y]$
    \end{itemize}
    \item (ii) $\rightarrow$ (iii)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $[x] = [y]$
        \item $[x] \cap [y] = [x]$ by Idempotent Law
        \item However, $x \lnot x$ by reflexivity
        \item This shows $x \in [x] = [x] \cap [y]$
        \item $\therefore [x] \cap [y] \neq \emptyset$
    \end{itemize}
    \item (iii) $\rightarrow$ (i)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $[x] \cap [y] \neq \emptyset$
        \item Take $z \in [x] \cap [y]$
        \item Then $z \in [x] and z \in [y]$ by definition of $\cap$
        \item Then $x \lnot z$ and $y \lnot z$ by definition of $[x]$ and $[y]$
        \item $y \lnot z$ implies $z \lnot y$ by symmetry
        \item $\therefore x \lnot y$ by transitivity

Proof Steps
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A / \lnot$ is a set by definition
    \item Show every element of $A / \lnot$ is a nonempty subset of $A$.
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Then $S = [x] \subseteq A$ by definition of equivalence classes
        \item $x \lnot x$ by reflexivity of $\lnot$
        \item Hence $x \in [x] = S$ by definition of $[x]$
        \item $\therefore S$ is non-empty
    \end{itemize}
    \item Show every element of $A$ is in at least one element of $A / \lnot$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Let $x \in A$
            \item $x \lnot x$ by reflexivity of $\lnot$
            \item $\therefore x \in [x] \in A / \lnot$
        \end{itemize}
    \item Show every element of $A$ is in at most one element of $A / \lnot$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $x \in A$  s.t. $x \in S_1, x \in S_2$
        \item Find $y_1, y_2 \in A$ s.t. $S_1 = [y_1]$ and $S_2 = [y_2]$
        \item $x \in [y_1] \cap [y_2]$
        \item $[y_1] \cap [y_2] \neq \emptyset$
        \item $\therefore S_1 = [y_1] = [y_2] = S_2$ by equivalence classes lemma

\section{8. Mathematical Induction}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sequence: Ordered set with members called terms. Can have infinite terms.
    \item Summation: $\sum_{k=m}^{n} a_k = a_m + a_{m+1} + ... + a_n$. $k$ is the index, $m$ is the lower limit, and $n$ is the upper limit.
    \item Product:
    $\prod_{k=m}^{n} a_k = a_m \cdot a_{m+1} \cdot ... \cdot a_n$.
    \item Theorem 5.1.1: Adding 2 summations is the same as the summation of adding both their terms. Multiplying a constant to all terms of a summation is equal to multiplying a constant to the result of the summation. Multiplying 2 products is the same as the product of multiplying both their terms. (Rewrite this if I'm not lazy)
    \item Arithmetic Sequence: A sequence where there is a constant $d$ such that $a_k = a_{k-1} + d$. Then $a_n = a_0 + dn$.
    \item Geometric Sequence: A sequence where there is a constant $r$ such that $a_k = ra_{k-1}$. Then $a_n = a_0 r^n$.
    \item Principle of Mathematical Induction: Let $P(n)$ be a property defined for integers and $a$ be a fixed integer. Then if $P(a)$ is true and $\forall k \geq a, P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$ then $\forall n \geq a, P(n)$.
    \item Closed Form: If a sum with variable number of terms is equal to a formula that does not have $(...)$ or $\sum$, the formula without those is the closed form.
    \item Theorem 5.2.3 Sum of a Geometric Sequence: For $r \neq 1$, $\sum_{i=0}^{n} r^i = \frac{r^{n+1}-1}{r-1}$.
    \item Proposition 5.3.1: $\forall n \geq 0, 2^{2n}-1 \equiv 0$ (mod 3).
    \item Proposition 5.3.2: $\forall n \geq 3, 2n+1 < 2^{n}$.
    \item Weak Mathematical Induction (1PI): Similar to PMI.
    \item Strong Mathematical Induction (2PI): Replace with $P(a) \land P(a+1) \land ... \land P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$ instead.
    \item Lecture 8 Slide 47: Any integer greater than 1 is divisible by a prime number.
    \item Lecture 8 Slide 48: Any amount $\geq$ \$12 can be formed by \$4 and \$5 coins.
    \item Well-Ordering Principle for Integers: Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ has a smallest element.
    \item Recurrence Relation: Formula that relates each term $a_k$ to certain predecessors. Initial conditions specify the values of those elements without predecessors.
    \item Recursive Definition of a Set:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Base Clause: Specify certain elements in $S$ (founders).
        \item Recursion Clause: Specify certain functions under which $S$ is closed (constructors).
        \item Minimality Clause: Membership for $S$ can be demonstrated by finitely many successsive applications of the above clauses.

\subsection{Theorem 5.2.2 Sum of the First $n$ Integers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof by Mathematical Induction
    \item Let $P(n) \equiv (1 + 2 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}), \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
    \item Basis Step: $1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}$, therefore $P(1)$ is true.
    \item Assume $P(k)$ is true for some $k \geq 1$. That is, $1 + 2 + ... + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$.
    \item Inductive Step:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}$
        \item $P(k+1)$ is true.

    \item For each $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ let $P(n)$ be $n \notin S$.
    \item Inductive Step:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ such that $P(0), P(1), ... P(k-1)$ are true.
        \item If $k \in S$, then $k$ is the smallest element of $S$, which is a contradiction.
        \item So $k \notin S$, and $P(k)$ is true.
    \end{itemize}
    \item $P(n)$ is true $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$.
    \item $S = \emptyset$ which is a contradiction.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cantor's Diagonalisation Argument}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $(0, 1)$ is countable.
    \item Since it is not finite, it is countably infinite.
    \item List the elments $x_i$ of $(0, 1)$ in a sequence as follows, where $a_{ij}$ is a digit:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $x_1 = 0.a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}...a_{1n}...$
        \item $x_2 = 0.a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}...a_{2n}...$
        \item $x_n = 0.a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}...a_{nn}...$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Now construct $d = 0.d_1d_2d_3...d_n...$ where $d_n \neq a_{nn}$.
    \item $d \in (0, 1)$, but $d \neq x_n$.
    \item We can always construct a new $d$ no matter the value of $n$, so $(0, 1)$ is uncountable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cardinality Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable: Start from middle then work outwards, alternating between negative and positive integers. This is the function
    \[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
      n / 2 & even \\
      -(n-1)/2 & odd
   \end{cases}
    \]
    \item $\mathbb{Q}^+$ is countable: Define a function to count all fractions in the following manner. \\
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{qpluscountable.png} \\
    \end{center}
    This function will be a bijection from $|\mathbb{Z}^+|$ to $|\mathbb{Q}^+|$.
    \item $\mathbb{Z}^+ \times \mathbb{Z}^+$ is countable: Similar to the previous proof, but it is $(x, y)$ instead of $\frac{x}{y}$. The function $f(x, y) = \frac{(x+y-2)(x+y-1)}{2} + x$ can be used.
    \item Lemma 9.4 Proof: Use sequence argument, alternatively take an element from each set.
    \item Cardinality of $|\mathbb{R}| = |(0, 1)|$: Let $F(x)$ be the projection of $x$ from the topmost point of the circle onto the number line.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{realcardinality.png} \\
    \end{center}
    If points on the circle represent $(0, 1)$, then $F(x)$ is a bijection from $(0, 1)$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

    \item Independent Events: $A$ and $B$ are independent iff $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$. Then $P(A|B)=P(A)$ and $P(B|A)=P(B)$.

    \item Tutorial 8 Question 7: The power set of a countably infinite set is uncountable. This can be proven by a diagonalisation argument.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is countable.
        \item $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is infinite as $A$ is infinite.
        \item There is a sequence $a$ where every element of $A$ appears exactly once.
        \item There is a sequence $B$ where every element of $\mathcal{P}(A)$ appears exactly once.
        \item Now define $B=\{a_i:a_i \notin b_i\}$.
        \item Note that $B\in\mathcal{P}(A)$.
        \item Then $B\neq B_i$ for all $i$.
        \item This is because if $a_i\notin B_i$, then $a_i\in B$, and if $a_i\in B_i$, then $a_i \notin B$. So in all cases, $B\neq B_i$.
        \item Since $B$ is not in the original sequence, this contradicts the claim that $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is countable.
        \item Therefore $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is uncountable.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Tutorial 9 Question 5: The number of circular permutations of $n$ objects is $(n-1)!$.
    \item Tutorial 9 Question 9:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If you randomly put 51 points in a unit square, there are always 3 points that can be covered by a circle with radius 1/7.
        \item Divide the unit square into 25 equal smaller squares. One small square must have at least three points. 
        \item The diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle we want to place, so it can be fully contained.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Tutorial 9 Question 10: Given any 5 distinct non-negative integers, two of them have a difference divisible by 4.
    \item Tutorial 9 Question 11:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A chessmaster has 11 weeks to prepare for a tournament. They play at least 1 game every day, but no more than 12 games in any week. There is a succession of consecutive days where the chess master will have played exactly 21 games.
        \item Consider 77 days, and $P_i$ as the cumulative number of games played including day $i$. All $1 \leq P_i \leq 132$, and are distinct. 
        \item Consider $Q_i = P_i+21$. The largest $Q_i$ possible is 153, and they are also distinct. 
        \item There are 154 possible numbers, but the range of $P_i$ and $Q_i$ is 153. There must be some $P_j=Q_i=P_i+21$.
        \item The chess master plays exactly 21 games from day $i+1$ to $j$.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 2: From Tutorial 9 Question 4: Put crosses on the side of all boxes. Choose 2 out of $n+1$ crosses to be the start and end of boxes with white balls. The number of ways is ${n+1 \choose 2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 6: For a random relation on a power set, what is the probability that the relation is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reflexive: Consider the $n$ by $n$ matrix. For a reflexive relation, all entries in the diagonal must be 1. For the remaining $n^2-n$ entries, they can be anything we wish. So $P(Reflexive)=\frac{2^{n^2-n}}{2^{n^2}}=\frac{1}{2^n}$.
        \item Symmetric: Consider the $n$ by $n$ matrix. For a symmetric relation, $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$. We can consider the lower triangular half of the matrix and the main diagonal, and let these be anything we want. There are $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$ entries, so $P(Symmetric)=\frac{2^{\frac{n^2+n}{2}}}{2^{n^2}}=\frac{1}{2^{\frac{n^2-n}{2}}}$.
        \item Antisymmetric: Entries on the main diagonal can be either 0 or 1. For a $a_{ij}$ in the lower triangular half of the matrix, there can be 3 possibilities: $i$ and $j$ are unrelated, $iRj$, or $jRi$. This gives $2^n\cdot3^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ relations, and a probability of $2^{n-n^2}\cdot3^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 8: There are 4 non-isomorphic undirected graphs with two vertices and two edges.
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 10: Given  group of people who shake hands including a host who shook hand with everyone else, there are at least two people who shook hands the same number of times.
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 11: A dominating set is a set of vertices in an undirected simple graph where every vertex outside of this set is adjacent to at least one vertex in this set. A minimal dominating set does not have a dominating proper subset.
    \item Tutorial 10 Question 11: For all simple graphs with 6 vertices, either the graph or its complement contains a triangle.
    \item Tutorial 11 Question 4: If a simple undirected graph is connected, then $|E| \geq |V|-1$. The converse is NOT true.
    \item Tutorial 11 Question 5: If a simple undirected graph is acyclic, then $|E| \leq |V|-1$. The converse is NOT true.
    \item Tutorial 11 Question 6: For a simple undirected graph, it is a tree iff there is exactly one path betewen every pair of vertices.
    \item Tutorial 11 Question 7: If separating stones into 2 piles gives $k_1\times k_2$ money, the maximum (only) amount of money you can earn is $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Imagine splitting as cutting all edges in the bipartite graph between the 2 resulting sets. Since every edge has to be cut, the total is the number of edges in the complete graph.
    \item Tutorial 11 Question 9: Number of binary trees with $n$ nodes is the $n$th Catalan Number. $C_n=\frac{1}{n+1}{2n \choose n}$. $C_i=1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132$.
